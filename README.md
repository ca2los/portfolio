# Creating a book

This is the first version of *my personal portfolio* where I'll be sharing the projects and studies that I find
useful. The framework has *three sections* to highlight the most important information about the mission and
capabilities. 

### v.1.0

This project makes use of:

- [x] `HTML 5 syntax` as the *main structure*
- [x] `LESS syntax` for *styling* the look and feel of the webpage
- [x] `Flexbox properties` for *Parent* and *Child* items
- [x] `Pseudo Slectors` for *first-child*, *last child*, *clicking states* and *afters* (some others too)
- [x] `:nth-childs` to manipulate *HTML* tags in responsive displays
- [x] `@medias` for responsive devices
