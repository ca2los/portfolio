# Portfolio
###### By Carlos Aguirre Oseguera

### GET TO KNOW ME
This is version of *my personal portfolio* has been updated to show my latest projects and studies at the Coding 
Bootcamp. The framework still has *three sections* to highlight the most important information about me and the 
projects I had been working on.

### v.1.1
###### August 21, 2021.

### NO FRAMEWORKS HERE!
The website is free of frameworks, because I feel more comfortable by working with my own structure and styling. I 
find more challenging and satisfying by creating elements by myself. I do have some framework alternatives, but I
try to avoid them.

### TECHNOLOGIES

- [x] `HTML 5 syntax` as the *main structure*
- [x] `LESS syntax` for *styling* the look and feel of the webpage
- [x] `Flexbox properties` for *Parent* and *Child* items
- [x] `Pseudo Slectors` for *first-child*, *last child*, *clicking states* and *afters* (some others too)
- [x] `:nth-childs` to manipulate *HTML* tags in responsive displays
- [x] `@medias` for responsive devices

### WHAT'S NEXT?
For a website like this, making use Javascript is not necessary. Instead, I'm waiting to get more used and comfortable
with **Node JS** or other technologies to implement some ideas.
